 Here is how I see the emoticons:

    Waving puff: "Hello"
    Laughing puff: "Hahahaha, f*** you"
    Surprised puff: "Oh damn, it's you again!?"
    Crying puff: "I f***ed up..."
    Angry puff: "I messed up, but it makes me angry that you will win because of this."

Here is how it should be:

    Waving puff: "Hello" (Or, a <New puff>: "Good luck, have fun!")
    <New puff>: "Good Game!"
    <New puff>: "Well Played!"
    <New puff>: "Your deck makes me puke..."
    <New puff>: "Awesome deck!"
